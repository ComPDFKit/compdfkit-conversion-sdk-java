*Learn more:* [*What is the authentication mechanism of ComPDF's license?*](https://www.compdf.com/faq/authentication-mechanism-of-compdfkit-license?utm_source=github&utm_medium=compdfkit-conversion-sdk-java&utm_campaign=compdfkit_conversion_sdk_java_repo&ref_platform_id=github_compdfkit)

**Copy the License Key:**

Accurately obtaining the license key is crucial for the application of the license.

1. In the email you received, locate the XML file containing the license key.
2. Open the XML file, and determine the license type based on the `<type>` field. If `<type>online</type>` is present, it indicates an online license. If `<type>offline</type>` is present or if the field is absent, it indicates an offline license.
- **Online License:**
  
      <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="no"?>
      <license version="1">
          <platform>windows</platform>
          <starttime>xxxxxxxx</starttime>
          <endtime>xxxxxxxx</endtime>
          <type>online</type>
          <key>LICENSE_KEY</key>
      </license>

- **Offline License**:
  
  ```xml
  <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="no"?>
  <license version="1">
      <platform>linux</platform>
      <starttime>xxxxxxxx</starttime>
      <endtime>xxxxxxxx</endtime>
      <key>LICENSE_KEY</key>
  </license>
  ```
3. Copy the value located at the LICENSE_KEY position within the `<key>LICENSE_KEY</key>` field. This is your license key.

**Apply the License Key**

You can perform offline authentication using the following method:

```java
import com.compdfkit.conversion.base.ErrorCode;
import com.compdfkit.conversion.LibraryManager;

String license = " ";
ErrorCode errorCode = LibraryManager.licenseVerify(license);
if (errorCode != ErrorCode.SUCCESS) {
    return;
}
String resourcePath = "";
LibraryManager.initialize(resourcePath);
